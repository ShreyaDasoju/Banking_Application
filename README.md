# Banking_Application
This python banking application simulation has a set list of usernames, and another with their corresponding passwords. 
Users are prompted to enter their username and password. If a match is found, the user is presented with 3 possible actions. 
They are able to transfer their funds between their chequing and savings account, or to e-transfer to another person within the initial list/database. 
After the selection and desired amount is inputted, the program returns the new balances of the individual. If there are problems with insufficient funds, error messages will be printed.
